# max_locations_to_report: 20

# The maximum number of genomic locations allowed per sequence.  If exceeded
# for a given sequence, only the number of genomic locations is preserved,
# while the actual locations are erased, and the sequence is not binned (i.e.
# it is only included in the isomiRs or no_genomic_hits tab).  Reported as
# "MLAE" (maximum locations allowed exceeded).  This may help reduce Prost!
# memory consumption in some data sets. Note that any sequence marked as
# MLAE will *not* be included when calculating normalization in the
# by_genomic_location tab.

# If the mature miR annotation file is given, then an extra column
# "MainSeqMatchesAnnotationFile" is added to the compressed_by_annotation tab
# in the Prost! output.  For a given AnnotationBin:
#   a) if the Bin has multiple in-species mature miR annotations, then the
#      column is marked "Multiple"
#   b) if the Bin's MainSequence exactly matches the annotation file's
#      annotated sequence, then the column is marked "Yes".
#   c) if the Bin's MainSequence does not exactly match the annotation file's
#      annotated sequence, then the column is marked "No".
# This column helps users assess the quality of the annotation file used.

# name: A human readable name for this alignment.
# tool: (bbmap|bbmapskimmer)
# db: Path to the aligner's reference.
# max_3p_mismatches: Maximum number of mismatches on the 3p end.
# max_non_3p_mismatches: Maximum number of mismatches on the 5p end and the
#   core of the alignment.  Effectively, this determines the maximum
#   designation of any sequence/bin in all Prost! output.
# allow_indels: (yes|no)
# type: Applicable only for AnnotationAlignments.
#   (MirbaseMirAnnotation|MirbaseHairpinAnnotation|BiomartOtherRNAAnnotation)
# indelnt_penalty_multiplier: Inserted/deleted nucleotides penalty multiplier (X).
#       Multiply the number of inserted or deleted nucleotides by X and add to
#       the number of non-3-prime mismatches in the alignment (Y); if Y is
#       greater than max_non_3p_mismatches, the hit will be rejected. 

# For the genome alignment, we recommend keeping the number of non-3-prime
# mismatches to '2' (i.e. 5-prime mismatches and "core" mismatches).
